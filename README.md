# Awesomesauce

This is a tribute to the old days of the web, back to the days when the web was a wild west of personal webpages, blinking text, and GIFs.

Awesomesauce is a dfront-end that makes use of [Wiby](https://wiby.me/) JSON API, Handlebars and Jquery to give you search results that are exclusively personal webpages from neocities.org.
